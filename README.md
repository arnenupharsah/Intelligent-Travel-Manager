  * User_ID: User ID
  * Timestamp: When a photo/video has been taken
  * Longitude: Longitude of entry
  * Latitude: Latitude of entry
  * Accuracy: GPS Accuracy level (16 - the most accurate, 1 - the least accurate)
  * Marker: 0 if the entry is photo, 1 if the entry is video
  * URL: flickr URL to the entry
 * ```trajectory_stats.csv```  Stats for each trajectory, output of ```src/generate_tables.py```
  * Each line shows statistics about corresponding trajectory
  * Trajectory_ID: Unique trajectory ID
  * User_ID: User ID
  * #Photo: Number of photos+videos in the trajectory
  * Start_Time: When the first photo/video has been taken
  * Travel_Distance(km): Sum of the distances between consecutive points (Euclidean Distance)
  * Total_Time(min): The time gap between the first photo and the last photo
  * Average_Speed(km/h): Travel_Distances(km)/Total_Time(h)
